Deduction:

[-0.1] Wrong table dropping order
[-0.1] Wrong records deletion order

[-0.3] Should not hard code IDs in test data.
       That will restrict future test data addition and is bad for the large amount of required test data.

[-0.1] Insert error
Msg 547, Level 16, State 0, Line 87
The INSERT statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint "FK__CustomerP__Custo__2136E270". The conflict occurred in database "LAB7", table "dbo.Customer", column 'CustomerID'.
The statement has been terminated.

[-0.1] Insert error
Msg 547, Level 16, State 0, Line 99
The INSERT statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint "FK__EmployeeP__Emplo__1C722D53". The conflict occurred in database "LAB7", table "dbo.Employee", column 'EmployeeID'.
The statement has been terminated.

[-0.1] No test data in table QueueUp

[-0.1] Unique key for Employee should be (SSN, StartDate)

[-0.1] Employee table missing address attributes


Suggestion:

- Should avoid using SQL keywords (e.g., order) to name data.
- Should comment out the select statements in the data insertion script.
